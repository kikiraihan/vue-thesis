Data search uses the breadth first search (BFS) technique on the GloBI graph in two layers of interactions, starting from the interactions of the viruses entered (1 ), then connected insect and plant interactions (2). The data is then preprocessed and standardized using the NCBI taxonomy via Wikidata as a hub. The stored data can be used for insect vector analysis.",
